# Exam_Timetabling

üìö **Exam Timetabling Project**

This is a Python-based implementation of the Exam Timetabling Problem for an academic scheduling scenario, featuring CSP algorithms and thorough comparisons.

### Problem Description

This project tackles the **exam timetabling problem**, a challenging constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The goal is to schedule exams for specific courses during an exam period of **21 consecutive days**, while respecting several constraints:

- Each exam lasts **3 hours**.
- There are **three available time slots per day**: 9-12, 12-3, and 3-6.
- Only **one exam can be held at a time** (single available exam room).
- Courses from the **same semester** must be scheduled on different days.
- Some courses have **labs that must immediately follow their theoretical exam on the same day** (e.g., 12-3 theory, 3-6 lab).
- Exams for **‚Äúdifficult‚Äù courses** must be at least **two days apart**.
- Exams for **courses taught by the same professor** must be on different days.

### What I Did

‚úÖ **Implemented** three CSP algorithms:
- **Forward Checking (FC)**
- **Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC)**
- **Min-Conflicts**

‚úÖ Used the **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)** heuristic and the **dom/wdeg** heuristic, based on:  
*"Boosting Systematic Search by Weighting Constraints" ‚Äì Boussemart et al., 2004.*

‚úÖ Based the implementation on the Python code from the AIMA repository:  
https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/blob/master/csp.py  
(along with `utils.py` and `search.py`).

‚úÖ Conducted **experimental comparisons** of the algorithms using provided data and defined appropriate **metrics**.

‚úÖ Identified and discussed the **minimum possible exam period duration** for the given problem instance.

‚úÖ Included **tables, metrics, and clear explanations of results**.
